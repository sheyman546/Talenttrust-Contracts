# Step-by-Step Testing Procedure for Cancel Contract State Guardrails

## Quick Summary of What Was Done

You have successfully implemented security guardrails for the `cancel_contract` function in the TalentTrust escrow contract. The fix prevents fund stranding and double-resolution by rejecting cancellation attempts from `Disputed` and `Refunded` states.

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Modified `cancel_contract` in `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs` with state guards and comprehensive documentation
2. ✅ Added 11 new comprehensive tests in `contracts/escrow/src/test/cancel_contract.rs`
3. ✅ Updated documentation in `docs/escrow/status-transition-guardrails.md`

---

## How to Test Your Implementation

### Test Level 1: Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

Run this command to ensure your code compiles and basic tests pass:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract --lib 2>&1 | head -50
```

**Expected Output:**
- Tests compile successfully (no syntax errors)
- At least 20 tests run
- All tests marked with `ok` or `ignored`
- No panic messages (unless `#[should_panic]` test)
- Summary line: `test result: ok. XX passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored`

**What this verifies:**
✅ Code compiles
✅ Basic test structure is correct
✅ No import errors

---

### Test Level 2: Disputed State Rejection Tests (10 minutes)

Run tests that verify cancellation is properly rejected from `Disputed` state:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts

# Test 1: Client cannot cancel from Disputed
echo "Test 1: Client cannot cancel from Disputed state"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::client_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract -- --nocapture

# Test 2: Freelancer cannot cancel from Disputed
echo "Test 2: Freelancer cannot cancel from Disputed state"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::freelancer_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract -- --nocapture

# Test 3: Arbiter cannot cancel from Disputed (unauthorized)
echo "Test 3: Arbiter cannot cancel (unauthorized role)"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::arbiter_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract -- --nocapture
```

**Expected Output for Each Test:**
- Test name shows in output
- Test passes (marked `ok`)
- Tests verify `InvalidStatusTransition` error is triggered
- No actual panic is printed (that's the #[should_panic] working correctly)

**What this verifies:**
✅ Disputed state correctly rejects cancellation from client
✅ Disputed state correctly rejects cancellation from freelancer
✅ Arbiter role is unauthorized to cancel
✅ Error message is `InvalidStatusTransition`

---

### Test Level 3: Refunded State Rejection Tests (10 minutes)

Run tests that verify cancellation is properly rejected from `Refunded` state:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts

# Test 1: Client cannot cancel from Refunded
echo "Test 1: Client cannot cancel from Refunded state"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::client_cannot_cancel_refunded_contract -- --nocapture

# Test 2: Freelancer cannot cancel from Refunded
echo "Test 2: Freelancer cannot cancel from Refunded state"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::freelancer_cannot_cancel_refunded_contract -- --nocapture
```

**Expected Output for Each Test:**
- Test name displays
- Test passes (marked `ok`)
- Both tests verify `InvalidStatusTransition` error

**What this verifies:**
✅ Refunded state correctly rejects cancellation
✅ Double-refund vulnerability is prevented
✅ Fund stranding is prevented

---

### Test Level 4: Valid Cancellation States (10 minutes)

Run tests that verify cancellation works correctly from allowed states:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts

# Test 1: Cancel from Created state
echo "Test 1: Cancel from Created state (before funding)"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::client_can_cancel_from_created_state -- --nocapture

# Test 2: Cancel from PartiallyFunded state
echo "Test 2: Cancel from PartiallyFunded state (partial deposit)"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::client_can_cancel_from_partially_funded_state -- --nocapture

# Test 3: Cancel from Funded state
echo "Test 3: Cancel from Funded state (all funds deposited)"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::client_can_cancel_from_funded_state -- --nocapture
```

**Expected Output for Each Test:**
- Test name displays
- Test passes (marked `ok`)
- State transitions are verified before and after cancellation
- Cancelled status is confirmed

**What this verifies:**
✅ Created state cancellation works
✅ PartiallyFunded state cancellation works
✅ Funded state cancellation works (economic deterrent scenario)
✅ All valid state transitions succeed

---

### Test Level 5: Security Invariants (10 minutes)

Run tests that verify security properties are maintained:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts

# Test 1: Double cancel fails (idempotency)
echo "Test 1: Double cancel fails with AlreadyCancelled"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::double_cancel_fails_with_already_cancelled -- --nocapture

# Test 2: Only client/freelancer can cancel (not arbiter)
echo "Test 2: Only client or freelancer can cancel"
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::only_client_or_freelancer_can_cancel -- --nocapture
```

**Expected Output for Each Test:**
- Test name displays
- Test passes (marked `ok`)
- Idempotency check verifies AlreadyCancelled error on retry
- Authorization check verifies UnauthorizedRole error for arbiter

**What this verifies:**
✅ Idempotency (double-cancel safe)
✅ Authorization model (arbiter cannot cancel)
✅ Error consistency

---

### Test Level 6: Full Test Suite (15 minutes)

Run the complete test suite for cancel_contract:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts
cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract
```

**Expected Output:**
```
running XX tests
cancel_contract::client_cancels_before_funding ... ok
cancel_contract::freelancer_cancels_before_funding ... ok
cancel_contract::client_cancels_after_funding_no_releases ... ok
cancel_contract::freelancer_cancels_after_funding ... ok
cancel_contract::arbiter_cancels_funded_contract ... ok
cancel_contract::unauthorized_user_cannot_cancel ... ok
cancel_contract::cannot_cancel_completed_contract ... ok
cancel_contract::client_cannot_cancel_after_milestone_release ... ok
cancel_contract::double_cancellation_fails ... ok
cancel_contract::freelancer_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract ... ok (IGNORED)
cancel_contract::client_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract ... ok (IGNORED)
... [11 new tests]

test result: ok. XX passed; 0 failed; YY ignored
```

**What this verifies:**
✅ All 20+ cancel_contract tests pass
✅ Pre-existing tests still work (no regressions)
✅ New tests all pass
✅ Proper mix of panicking and successful tests

---

### Test Level 7: Full Escrow Contract Test Suite (30 minutes)

Run all tests for the entire escrow contract:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts
cargo test -p escrow 2>&1 | tail -20
```

**Expected Output Summary:**
```
test result: ok. XXX passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored

test result: ok (XXX passed in YYs)
```

**What this verifies:**
✅ No regressions in other contract tests
✅ Integration with other operations works
✅ All escrow contract tests pass

---

### Test Level 8: Code Quality Checks (10 minutes)

Ensure the code meets quality standards:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts

# Check formatting
echo "=== Checking code formatting ==="
cargo fmt --all -- --check
echo "Format check result: $?"

# Check linting (warnings as errors)
echo ""
echo "=== Running clippy linter ==="
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -10
echo "Clippy check completed"

# Build the contract
echo ""
echo "=== Building contract ==="
cargo build -p escrow
echo "Build completed"
```

**Expected Output:**
- Format check: No changes needed (exit code 0)
- Clippy: No warnings or errors
- Build: Completes successfully with no errors

**What this verifies:**
✅ Code follows Rust formatting standards
✅ Code passes linter checks
✅ Code compiles without warnings

---

### Test Level 9: Performance Tests (15 minutes)

Ensure performance baselines are met:

```bash
cd /workspaces/Talenttrust-Contracts
cargo test -p escrow test::performance 2>&1
```

**Expected Output:**
- Performance tests run
- Tests show gas usage or latency metrics
- Tests pass (marked `ok`)
- No significant regression from baseline

**What this verifies:**
✅ No performance regressions
✅ Gas usage is within acceptable range
✅ State guards don't add significant overhead

## Interpreting Test Results

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Test output shows `test result: ok`
- No panic traces unless `#[should_panic]` test
- Number of passed tests increases (11 new tests added)
- No compilation warnings
- All assertions pass

### ⚠️ Warning Signs
- Test output shows `test result: FAILED`
- Panic traces without `#[should_panic]` marker
- Compilation warnings
- Assertions fail
- Test name appears but test disappears (timeout)

### 🔍 Debug If Tests Fail

If a test fails, check:

1. **Compilation Error:** Read the error message carefully
   ```bash
   # Get full error output
   cargo test -p escrow cancel_contract::TEST_NAME 2>&1
   ```

2. **Runtime Panic:** Check if it's a `#[should_panic]` test
   ```bash
   # View the test source
   grep -A 20 "fn TEST_NAME" contracts/escrow/src/test/cancel_contract.rs
   ```

3. **State Machine Issue:** Verify contract states
   ```bash
   # Check ContractStatus enum
   grep -A 20 "pub enum ContractStatus" contracts/escrow/src/types.rs
   ```

4. **Authorization Issue:** Verify caller
   ```bash
   # Check if caller is client, freelancer, or arbiter
   grep -B 5 "UnauthorizedRole" contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs
   ```

---

## Expected Test Output Example

```
test cancel_contract::client_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract - should panic ... ok
test cancel_contract::client_cannot_cancel_refunded_contract - should panic ... ok
test cancel_contract::client_can_cancel_from_created_state ... ok
test cancel_contract::client_can_cancel_from_partially_funded_state ... ok
test cancel_contract::client_can_cancel_from_funded_state ... ok
test cancel_contract::freelancer_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract - should panic ... ok
test cancel_contract::freelancer_cannot_cancel_refunded_contract - should panic ... ok
test cancel_contract::arbiter_cannot_cancel_disputed_contract - should panic ... ok
test cancel_contract::double_cancel_fails_with_already_cancelled ... ok
test cancel_contract::only_client_or_freelancer_can_cancel - should panic ... ok

test result: ok. 20 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

## Property-Based Testing: Accounting Invariants

### Overview

The escrow contract maintains three accounting fields on each `Contract`:
- `funded_amount` — total stroops deposited by the client
- `released_amount` — total stroops released to the freelancer
- `refunded_amount` — total stroops refunded back to the client

The **core invariant** is:

```
funded_amount - released_amount - refunded_amount >= 0
```

Equivalently, `released_amount + refunded_amount <= funded_amount`. This must
hold at all times, regardless of operation order, interleaving, or failures.

### Properties Asserted (`contracts/escrow/src/proptest.rs`)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `prop_accounting_invariant_holds_under_random_ops` | Random sequences of deposit/approve/release/refund; invariant checked after every operation. |
| `prop_full_release_sequence_invariant` | Deposit exact total, approve and release each milestone in order. Status ends at `Completed`. |
| `prop_full_refund_sequence_invariant` | Deposit exact total, refund all milestones. Status ends at `Refunded`. |
| `prop_mixed_release_refund_invariant` | Release first k milestones, refund the rest. Status ends at `Completed`. |
| `prop_double_release_rejected_invariant_preserved` | Releasing the same milestone twice is rejected; state unchanged. |
| `prop_overdeposit_rejected_invariant_preserved` | Depositing beyond the contract total is rejected; state unchanged. |
| `prop_empty_sequence_invariant` | Invariant holds with zero operations after creation. |
| `prop_release_without_approval_rejected` | Release without prior approval fails; invariant preserved. |
| `prop_status_transitions_monotone` | Status moves monotonically toward terminal states (Completed, Refunded). |
| `prop_large_amounts_invariant_preserved` | Near-`i128::MAX` milestone amounts do not overflow; invariant holds. |

### Running the Property Tests

```bash
# Default: 256 cases per property
cargo test -p escrow proptest

# Increase coverage:
PROPTEST_CASES=1024 cargo test -p escrow proptest

# Reproduce a specific failure:
PROPTEST_SEED=<hex> cargo test -p escrow proptest
```

All runs use proptest's default deterministic seed. Failing seeds are
automatically saved to `proptest-regressions/proptest.txt` for replay.

### Security Model

The property tests assume `env.mock_all_auths()`, which bypasses
signature verification. The tests therefore validate **logic invariants**,
not authentication. Authentication is tested separately in
`test/access_control.rs` and similar modules.

**Accounting invariant (non-negativity):**

```
funded_amount - released_amount - refunded_amount >= 0
```

This prevents:
- **Over-release**: releasing more than was deposited
- **Over-refund**: refunding more than the available balance
- **Accounting drift**: state corruption due to ordering bugs

**Status transition monotonicity:**

```
Created -> Funded -> Completed   (forward, no skipping)
Created -> Funded -> Refunded    (all milestones refunded)
Funded  -> Completed             (mixed release + refund)
```

Terminal states (`Completed`, `Refunded`, `Cancelled`) are absorbing.
No operation can change them once reached.

### Edge Cases Covered

- **Max-value amounts**: milestones near `i128::MAX` (3× `i128::MAX / 3`)
- **Interleaved release/refund**: mixed sequences across milestone indices
- **Empty sequences**: contract creation with zero subsequent operations
- **Failed operations**: invariant holds even when operations panic
- **Double operations**: double-release, over-deposit rejected cleanly
- **Approval requirement**: release without prior approval is rejected
