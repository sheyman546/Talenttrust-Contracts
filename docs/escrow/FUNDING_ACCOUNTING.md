# Funding Accounting Invariants

## Overview

The Escrow contract implements comprehensive funding accounting invariants to ensure the integrity and security of fund management. These invariants guarantee that funds are properly tracked, released only when authorized, and that the contract state remains consistent at all times.

## Core Invariants

### 1. Funding Balance Invariant

**Formula:** `total_available = total_funded - total_released`

**Description:** The amount available for release must always equal the total deposited funds minus the total released funds.

**Enforcement:** Checked in `check_funding_invariants()` before and after any fund operation.

**Violation Scenario:** If a bug causes `total_available` to be incorrectly calculated, this invariant will catch it.

### 2. No Over-Release Invariant

**Formula:** `total_released ≤ total_funded`

**Description:** The contract can never release more funds than have been deposited.

**Enforcement:** Checked in `check_funding_invariants()` and validated during milestone release operations.

**Violation Scenario:** Prevents double-release bugs or arithmetic errors that could drain the contract.

### 3. Non-Negative Amounts Invariant

**Formulas:**
- `total_funded ≥ 0`
- `total_released ≥ 0`
- `total_available ≥ 0`

**Description:** All funding amounts must be non-negative. Negative values indicate corrupted state.

**Enforcement:** Checked in `check_funding_invariants()`.

**Violation Scenario:** Detects integer underflow or state corruption.

### 4. Milestone Release Consistency Invariant

**Formula:** `sum(milestone.amount for milestone in milestones where milestone.released) = total_released + accumulated_protocol_fees_for_milestones`

**Description:** Due to Hybrid Accounting, the sum of all released milestone amounts must exactly match the tracked total released plus the accrued protocol fees deducted from those milestones. The protocol fee is a percentage of the milestone amount (e.g. `fee = (amount * bps + 9999) / 10000`).

**Enforcement:** Checked in `check_milestone_invariants()`.

**Violation Scenario:** Prevents inconsistency between milestone state and accounting totals, ensuring protocol fees are correctly tracked.

### 5. Milestone Amount Validity Invariant

**Formula:** `milestone.amount > 0` for all milestones

**Description:** All milestone amounts must be positive. Zero or negative amounts are invalid.

**Enforcement:** Checked during contract creation and in `check_milestone_invariants()`.

**Violation Scenario:** Prevents creation of invalid milestones that could cause accounting errors.

### 6. Contract Value Invariant

**Formula:** `sum(milestone.amount for all milestones) ≥ total_funded`

**Description:** The total contract value (sum of all milestones) must be at least equal to the total funded amount.

**Enforcement:** Checked in `check_contract_invariants()`.

**Violation Scenario:** Prevents over-funding beyond the contract's total value.

## Data Structures

### FundingAccount

```rust
pub struct FundingAccount {
    /// Total amount deposited into the contract
    pub total_funded: i128,
    /// Total amount released to freelancer across all milestones
    pub total_released: i128,
    /// Total amount available for release
    pub total_available: i128,
}
```

**Invariants Maintained:**
- `total_available = total_funded - total_released`
- All fields are non-negative
- `total_released ≤ total_funded`

### Milestone

```rust
pub struct Milestone {
    pub amount: i128,
    pub released: bool,
}
```

**Invariants Maintained:**
- `amount > 0`
- `released` flag accurately reflects whether funds have been released

### EscrowState

```rust
pub struct EscrowState {
    pub client: Address,
    pub freelancer: Address,
    pub status: ContractStatus,
    pub milestones: Vec<Milestone>,
    pub funding: FundingAccount,
}
```

**Invariants Maintained:**
- All invariants from `FundingAccount` and `Milestone`
- `status` transitions follow valid state machine
- Milestone vector is non-empty

## Invariant Checking Functions

### check_funding_invariants(&FundingAccount)

Verifies all funding-related invariants:
1. `total_available = total_funded - total_released`
2. `total_released ≤ total_funded`
3. `total_funded ≥ 0`
4. `total_released ≥ 0`
5. `total_available ≥ 0`

**Usage:** Call after any deposit or release operation.

**Panics:** If any invariant is violated with descriptive error message.

### check_milestone_invariants(&Vec<Milestone>, total_released: i128)

Verifies milestone-related invariants:
1. Sum of released milestone amounts equals `total_released`
2. All milestone amounts are positive

**Usage:** Call after any milestone state change.

**Panics:** If any invariant is violated with descriptive error message.

### check_contract_invariants(&EscrowState)

Verifies complete contract state by calling:
1. `check_funding_invariants()`
2. `check_milestone_invariants()`
3. Contract value invariant check

**Usage:** Call after any state modification to ensure complete consistency.

**Panics:** If any invariant is violated with descriptive error message.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

1. **Double-Release Attack:** Attacker attempts to release the same milestone twice.
   - **Mitigation:** Milestone `released` flag prevents re-release; invariants verify consistency.

2. **Over-Release Attack:** Attacker attempts to release more than deposited.
   - **Mitigation:** `total_released ≤ total_funded` invariant prevents this.

3. **State Corruption:** Bug or exploit corrupts internal state.
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive invariant checks detect corruption immediately.

4. **Arithmetic Overflow:** Large amounts cause integer overflow.
   - **Mitigation:** Use `checked_add()` for all arithmetic; validate amounts at creation.

5. **Unauthorized Release:** Non-authorized party releases funds.
   - **Mitigation:** Access control checks (to be implemented in full contract).

### Best Practices

1. **Always Check Invariants:** Call appropriate invariant check after any state modification.
2. **Fail Fast:** Panic on invariant violation rather than continuing with corrupted state.
3. **Descriptive Errors:** Error messages clearly indicate which invariant was violated.
4. **Atomic Operations:** Ensure state updates are atomic; either all succeed or all fail.
5. **Audit Trail:** Log all fund operations for post-mortem analysis.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Contract with Invariant Validation

```rust
let env = Env::default();
let client = Address::generate(&env);
let freelancer = Address::generate(&env);
let milestones = vec![&env, 500_i128, 500_i128];

// Create contract - validates milestone amounts
let contract_id = Escrow::create_contract(&env, &client, &freelancer, &milestones);

// Create state for verification
let state = EscrowState {
    client,
    freelancer,
    status: ContractStatus::Created,
    milestones,
    funding: FundingAccount {
        total_funded: 0,
        total_released: 0,
        total_available: 0,
    },
};

// Verify all invariants
Escrow::check_contract_invariants(&state);
```

### Depositing Funds with Invariant Validation

```rust
// Deposit funds
let amount = 1000_i128;
Escrow::deposit_funds(&env, contract_id, amount);

// Update funding account
let mut funding = state.funding;
funding.total_funded += amount;
funding.total_available += amount;

// Verify invariants maintained
Escrow::check_funding_invariants(&funding);
```

### Releasing a Milestone with Invariant Validation

```rust
// Release milestone
let milestone_id = 0;
let milestone_amount = state.milestones[milestone_id].amount;

// Update state
state.milestones[milestone_id].released = true;
state.funding.total_released += milestone_amount;
state.funding.total_available -= milestone_amount;

// Verify all invariants
Escrow::check_contract_invariants(&state);
```

## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Regular Checks

1. **After Each Operation:** Call appropriate invariant check function
2. **Before Persistence:** Verify complete state before storing
3. **After Retrieval:** Verify state immediately after loading from storage

### Monitoring

1. **Invariant Violations:** Log all violations with full context
2. **Performance:** Monitor invariant check performance
3. **Coverage:** Maintain 95%+ test coverage

### Debugging

If an invariant is violated:

1. **Identify Violation:** Error message indicates which invariant failed
2. **Trace Operation:** Review recent operations that led to violation
3. **Analyze State:** Examine all related state variables
4. **Implement Fix:** Correct the bug causing violation
5. **Add Test:** Add regression test for the specific scenario
